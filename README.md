# Basic Ulti Stats v2

Remaking the legendary basic-ulti-stats using real web technologies this time.

A number of issues need to addressed to move this project forward. See below:

1) This project is difficult to build on windows - see https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/

2) The technologies used are at least one year out of date. React, gatsby, etc. all need to be updated.

3) The code itself needs refactoring once the upgrade is complete - e.g. using React hooks as well as general cleaning up of the code.

4) Some of the content needs updating, e.g. pointing users to this repo to contribute in the about section, maybe updating some of the UI to give a better experience.
