# Basic Ulti Stats v2

Remaking the legendary basic-ulti-stats using real web technologies this time.

A number of issues need to addressed to move this project forward. See below:

1) This project is difficult to build on windows - see https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/

2) The technologies used are at least one year out of date. React, gatsby, etc. all need to be updated.
